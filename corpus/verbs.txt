# hahaha whoa this one's a fun one
# [word,word2] exapnds into all its possibilities
# so like "[i,you] want" will generate
# two separate sentences for "i want" and "you want"

# then, @thing expands to a thing (nouns.txt), and @thing.plural expands
# to a plural thing, @thing.singular gets a singular thing

# you also have @characterOrThing and @character
