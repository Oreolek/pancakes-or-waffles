# hahaha whoa this one's a fun one
# [word,word2] exapnds into all its possibilities
# so like "[i,you] want" will generate
# two separate sentences for "i want" and "you want"

# then, @thing expands to a thing (nouns.txt), and @thing.s expands
# to a plural thing, @thing.any gets a random plural or singular thing

[I,you,they,somebody] should $1
[I,they] want to $1
[I,you,they] have to $1
[I,you,they] must $1
[I,you,they] [should, must, want to, have to] $1
should [you,we,I] $1?
surely [I,they,you,we]'d $1
it's [about time, time, finally time] for [me,you] to $1
[at last, at long last, finally] [you,I] [must,should] $1
if you don't mind me asking, [would you, can I, may I] $1?
[I,you,we] [shall,must,may] $1 as @thing [told,foretold,warned us about,said]
@thing.any can $1
[Can,Should] @thing.any $1?
$1?
