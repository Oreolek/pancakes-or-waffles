# hahaha whoa this one's a fun one
# [word,word2] exapnds into all its possibilities
# so like "[i,you] want" will generate
# two separate sentences for "i want" and "you want"

# then, @thing expands to a thing (nouns.txt), and @thing.s expands
# to a plural thing, @thing.any gets a random plural or singular thing

[i,you,they] should $1
[i,they] want to $1
[i,you,they] have to $1
[i,you,they] must $1
surely [I,they,you]'d $1
it's [about time,time] for [me,you] to $1
finally [you,i] [must,should] $1
[at last, at long last] [you,i] [must,should] $1
if you don't mind me asking, would you $1?
[I,you] [shall,must,may] $1 as the [legend,prophecy,book,elders] foretold
[I,you] [shall,must,may] $1 as @thing foretold
You [may,should,shall] $1 because [i,we] [allow,demand] it
@thing can $1
@thing.s can $1
Can @thing $1?
$1?
