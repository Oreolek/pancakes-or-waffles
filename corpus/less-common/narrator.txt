[i,you,they] should $1
[i,they] want to $1
[i,you,they] have to $1
[i,you,they] must $1
surely [I,they,you]'d $1
it's [about time,time] for [me,you] to $1
finally [you,i] [must,should] $1
[at last, at long last] [you,i] [must,should] $1
if you don't mind me asking, would you $1?
[I,you] [shall,must,may] $1 as the [legend,prophecy,book] foretold
