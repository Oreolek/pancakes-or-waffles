[I,you,they] [should, must, want to, have to] $1
surely [I,they,you]'d $1
it's [about time, time, finally time] for [me,you] to $1
[at last, at long last, finally] [you,I] [must,should] $1
if you don't mind me asking, [would you, can I, may I] $1?
[I,you] [shall,must,may] $1 as the [legend,prophecy,book,elders] foretold
You [may,should,shall] $1 because [I,we] [allow,demand] it
